    /**
     * 1. Create 2 packages with names model and persistence
     *
     * 2. In 'model' package create a class Student. For each column in students table, declare a corresponding variable in Student class
     *
     * 3. In 'persistence' package create DatabaseUtils class
     * 3.1 In DatabaseUtils declare 3 constants (private final static) that holds data necessary for database connection:
        - db_host: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sda-jdbc-##"
        - db_username
        - db_password
     *  3.2 In DatabaseUtils create a static method that returns an instance of Connection
     *
     * 4. In 'persistence' package create StudentRepository class
     * 4.1 In StudentRepository:
        - create a method called 'findById' that accepts a parameter of type int and returns an object of type Student
        - get a database connection using DatabaseUtils class
        - get a prepared statement from connection, and execute a select query that fetch a row from students table by id
        - on preparedStatement, set method input as query parameter
        - create a Student instance
        - iterate over ResultSet and map data from row to corresponding field of student object
        - return student instance
     *
     * 5. In this class, in main method, create StudentRepository object and get a student with specific id from database.
     * 6. Print student to console
     *
     * Great! You successfully map a row from database to a Java object. Maybe Hibernate can help you to do this easily.
